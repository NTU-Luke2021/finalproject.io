## English Summary
### Key Insights
From 2009 to 2022, suicide rates among 15 ~ 24 year-olds fluctuated but increased overall, from 161 in 2014 to 264 in 2022, a 160% rise. On the other hand, from Suicidal Attempt reports we can see a sharp increment since 2018, and tripling since 2004. Over the same period, antidepressant drug usages under the age of 30 also nearly doubled. <br><br>

Student counseling sessions at NTU rose from 3,400 to over 11,000 annually, while NCKU experienced a 400% increase over 15 years, highlighting increased demand and strain on campus mental health services.<br><br>

These patterns suggest a widening mental health crisis among young people in Taiwan. While antidepressant use and campus counseling demand have surged, suicide rates and attempts have nonetheless continued to climb. This mismatch points to a gap between treatment access and treatment effectiveness, as well as the growing burden placed on university counseling systems. These underscore the urgent need for stronger policy support, expanded resources, and more comprehensive approaches to youth mental health.

### On-the-Ground Challenges of Campus Counselors
Counselors manage complex student cases, administrative duties, and counseling interchangeably, leading to significant cognitive load and burnout. Take NTU as an example, during the past 5 years, 3751 more students seek help from the Student Counseling Center, however the center only hired 18 more counselors, leading to an average one-month waiting time. Moreover, Taiwan’s policy equates to 1 mental health counselor per 1,200 students, which is far below international standards (e.g., 1:477 in the U.S., 1:270 in the U.K.).<br><br>
Additionally, compensation is capped: NTU offers NT$38,770 for bachelor’s-level staff and NT$43,630 for master’s-level counselors, both of which fall below Taiwan’s average salary. As a result, many counselors are forced to take on side jobs in order to sustain their livelihoods. As a result, students’ counseling sessions were 'compressed', and counselors became distracted from focusing fully on students’ mental health needs.<br>

### Gaps & Student Perspectives
We conducted a survey that revealed:<br>
1. Misaligned expectations persist: Students hoped for “problem-solving therapists,” but counselors function more as emotional coaches rather than fixers.<br>
2. Counseling spaces feel cramped, sterile, and uncomfortable, which affects student willingness to seek support.<br>
3. Many students support the adoption of “psychological leave”. Yet, social stigma (e.g., labeling, teacher attitudes) remains a barrier.<br>

   <sub>Note: "Psychological Leave" allows students to take up to three classes off per semester for mental health issues)</sub><br><br>
   --Students value psychological leaves highly themselves (76.8% positive), but they see professors as slightly less supportive (46% positive).<br>
   --This gap suggests a perceived misalignment: students strongly support mental health leave, but fewer feel professors share that level of positivity.<br>
   --Neutral responses are higher for professors’ attitudes (40% vs 17.4%), which may indicate uncertainty about institutional or faculty support<br><br>

### Conclusion
Taken together, these findings highlight a growing mental health crisis among young people in Taiwan, exacerbated by rising suicide rates and suicidal attempts despite increased antidepressant use and counseling demand. University counseling centers are under significant strain, with limited staff, capped compensation, and high cognitive load, which reduces the quality and accessibility of support. Meanwhile, student expectations and institutional realities are misaligned: while students highly value initiatives like psychological leave, perceived faculty support lags behind, indicating gaps in the broader campus culture around mental health.<br><br>
Addressing this complex challenge will require a multi-pronged approach: expanding counseling resources, improving compensation and staffing, aligning faculty and institutional attitudes with student needs, and implementing more holistic mental health policies. Without these measures, the gap between demand for mental health support and the system’s capacity to provide it is likely to widen, further affecting student well-being.
