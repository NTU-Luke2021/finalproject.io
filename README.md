## English Summary
### Key Insights
1. From 2009 to 2022, suicide rates among 15 ~ 24year-olds fluctuated but increased overall, from 161 in their low year up to 264 in 2022, a 160% rise. Suicidal behavior reports tripled, and antidepressant drug usages nearly doubled over the same period.<br><br>

2. Student counseling sessions at NTU rose from 3,400 to over 11,000 annually, while NCKU experienced a 400% increase over 15 years, highlighting increased demand and strain on campus mental health services.<br><br>

3. Taiwan’s policy equates to 1 mental health counselor per 1,200 students, which is far below international standards (e.g., 1:477 in the U.S., 1:270 in the U.K.).<br><br>

### On-the-Ground Challenges of Campus Psychologists
1. Counselors manage complex student cases, administrative duties, and counseling interchangeably, leading to significant cognitive load and burnout.<br>
2. Compensation is capped: NTU offers NT$38,770 for bachelor's-level staff and NT$43,630 for master’s counselors, which are both below-average-salary in Taiwan.<br><br>

### Gaps & Student Perspectives
1. Misaligned expectations persist: Students hoped for “problem-solving therapists,” but counselors function more as emotional coaches rather than fixers.<br>
2. Counseling spaces feel cramped, sterile, and uncomfortable, which affects student willingness to seek support.<br>
3. We conducted a survey (n=86) that revealed: <br>
   <img src="img/Student.png" style="display:inline-block; margin-right:10px" width="355"/>
   <img src="img/Professsor.png" style="display:inline-block; margin-right:10px" width="400"/>
   
   --Students value psychological leaves highly themselves (76.8% positive), but they see professors as slightly less supportive (46% positive).<br>
   --This gap suggests a perceived misalignment: students strongly support mental health leave, but fewer feel professors share that level of positivity.<br>
   --Neutral responses are higher for professors’ attitudes (40% vs 17.4%), which may indicate uncertainty about institutional or faculty support<br><br>
   Note: Psychological leaves allow students to take up to 3 classes off per semester for mental health<br><br>
### Conclusion
Many students support the adoption of “psychological leave”. Yet, awareness is low, and stigma (e.g., labeling, teacher attitudes) remains a barrier. Therefore, we proposed 4 suggestions for improvement.<br>
1. Introduce emotional education courses to reduce counseling pressure
2. Strengthen counselor visibility and clarity around psychological leave policies
3. Provide pre-counseling materials to help students articulate their thoughts and expectations
4. Foster a campus culture where mental well-being is understood, de-stigmatized, and supported institutionally.
