## English Summary
### Key Findings & Insights
1. From 2009 to 2022, suicide rates among 15–24-year-olds fluctuated but increased overall—from 161 in their low year up to 264 in 2022, a 1.6-fold rise. Suicidal behavior reports tripled, and antidepressant drug usages nearly doubled over the same period.<br>
2. Individual counseling sessions at NTU rose from 3,400 to over 11,000 annually, while NCKU experienced a fourfold increase over 15 years, highlighting increased demand and strain on campus mental health services.<br>
3. Taiwan’s policy equates to 1 mental health counselor per 1,200 students, which is far below international standards (e.g., 1:477 in the U.S., 1:270 in the U.K.).<br><br>

### On-the-Ground Challenges of Campus Psychologists
1. Counselors manage complex student cases, administrative duties, and counseling interchangeably, leading to significant cognitive load and burnout.<br>
2. Compensation is capped—e.g., NTU offers NT$38,770 for bachelor's-level staff and NT$43,630 for master’s plus certification—driving counselors to seek external gigs.<br><br>

### Gaps & Student Perspectives
1. Misaligned expectations persist: Students hoped for “problem-solving therapists,” but counselors function more as emotional coaches rather than fixers.<br>
2. Counseling spaces feel cramped, sterile, and uncomfortable, which affects student willingness to seek support.<br>
3. Many students support the adoption of “psychological leave”, which allows students to take up to 3 classes off per semester for mental health.Yet, awareness is low, and stigma (e.g., labeling, teacher attitudes) remains a barrier.<br>
4. We conducted a survey (n=86) that revealed: ~50% knew about psychological leave but didn’t understand its rules; ~76% held positive views; fewer than 10 had actually used it; however, the majority expressed willingness if needed.<br>
